							<h2>JOSH SWOPE</h2>
							<p>"Through my time as being Vice President for the past year in 
								Astronomy, I have quickly learned all of what goes into the 
								club, and more importantly what we can accomplish for the future 
								of our club. From building community by hosting the Starbeque events 
								each semester, to even taking several small groups to teach 
								astrophotography both on and off campus, I have always had a passion 
								for stars and for leadership. I was the president of the American 
								Sign Language Club this past year, and through my leadership was
							     able to increase regular participation from 2 members per meeting 
								 last year, to a steady, active, and excited 15+ members per meeting, 
								 as well as tripling our original budget through fundraising and 
								 campaigning in one semester. I have plans for the expansion of the 
								 Astronomy club such as increasing active membership, co-hosting 
								 more events with other organizations on campus, and creating more 
								 Astronomy events, all while still upholding the Astronomy Club’s 
								 beliefs and traditions. I plan to shoot for the moon with my passion 
								 for the stars, vote Josh Swope for Astronomy Club President."</p>

							<h2>KINJEE BHATT</h2>
							<p>"Hey guys my name is Kinjee, and I’m currently a member of the 
								astronomy club here at Furman. As the president of this club, 
								I hope to continue practicing some of my favorite parts of the 
								club, such as starbeque, and planetarium shows. A few things 
								I would introduce to the club would be visiting regional 
								observatories, and perhaps introducing CLP’s that are hosted 
								by specialists in astronomy-related fields. I think through 
								having these events, we would be able to grow the club, and 
								increase retention."</p>
