							<h2>KINJEE BHATT</h2>
								<p>"Hey guys my name is Kinjee, and I’m currently a member of the astronomy club 
									here at Furman. As the president of this club, I hope to continue practicing 
									some of my favorite parts of the club, such as starbeque, and planetarium 
									shows. A few things I would introduce to the club would be visiting regional 
									observatories, and perhaps introducing CLP’s that are hosted by specialists in 
									astronomy-related fields. I think through having these events, we would be 
									able to grow the club, and increase retention."</p>

							<h2>ELIZA PIETT</h2>
								<p>"I would be absolutely thrilled to fill the role of vice president of 
									Astronomy Club! With this position, I would maintain strong, consistent 
									communication with the president; assisting whatever needs come their way! 
									Next year, my schedule is commitment-free (in regards to other club 
									activity), so I would have more than enough time to maintain membership 
									for Astronomy Club! As for the fulfillment of presidential duties, while 
									I’m currently uneducated in the operation of the planetarium, I am a fast 
									learner! Beyond the planetarium, I am reliable in matters of communication 
									and scheduling, so presidency would be a position I'd confidently fill 
									(in circumstances of absence/vacancy). As a sophomore, this position would 
									be a beneficial learning experience. I assure you that I would not neglect 
									the responsibility that comes with it!"</p>
